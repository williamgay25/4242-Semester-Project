# GAMP - Generate a Music Playlist

Welcome to GAMP! This is an inefficient web application for generating new playlists, built for a class project. Please note that the client and server each have their own README files, which provide additional information on how to run and use each component.

## Overview

GAMP allows users to generate new playlists by selecting the desired song, artist, year, and length. The server-side code uses this information to run a clustering algorithm to return a playlist that fits the criteria. The client-side code then displays this list in a table format, allowing users to browse the available tracks and save their favorite ones to a local storage.

## Inefficiency

It's worth noting that GAMP was intentionally built to be inefficient, as a learning exercise for the class. The code is not optimized for performance or scalability and may not work well under heavy load. We encourage users to treat this project as a learning resource and not as a production-ready application.

## Getting Started

To get started with GAMP, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Open two terminal windows and navigate to the project directory using `cd` in both windows.
3. In one of the terminal windows, navigate to the client directory using `cd client`.
4. Follow the instructions in the `README` file in the client directory to start the client server.
5. In the other terminal window, navigate to the server directory using `cd server`.
6. Follow the instructions in the `README` file in the server directory to start the server.
7. Both the client and server servers must be running in order for GAMP to work properly.

We hope you enjoy using GAMP and learning from our project!
