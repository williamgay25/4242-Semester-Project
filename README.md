# GAMP - Generate a Music Playlist

Welcome to GAMP! This is an inefficient web application for generating new playlists, built for a class project. Please note that the client and server each have their own README files, which provide additional information on how to run and use each component.

## Overview

GAMP allows users to generate new playlists by selecting the desired song, artist, year, and length. The server-side code uses this information to run a clustering algorithm to return a playlist that fits the criteria. The client-side code then displays this list in a table format, allowing users to browse the available tracks and save their favorite ones to a local storage.

## Inefficiency

It's worth noting that GAMP was intentionally built to be inefficient, as a learning exercise for the class. The code is not optimized for performance or scalability and may not work well under heavy load. We encourage users to treat this project as a learning resource and not as a production-ready application.
